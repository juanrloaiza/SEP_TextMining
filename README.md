# Text mining on the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_

This repository includes a series of Jupyter Notebooks that sketch a data analysis project based on the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. It includes the following notebooks:

* Scraper - Gets the articles from the SEP and saves them to disk (raw).
* Preprocessing - Using NLTK, it processes the raw data into several types of data that can be analyzed.
* Analytics - Runs a series of exploratory analyses regarding word frequencies and NER recognition.
* LDA Topic Modeling - Implements LDA models for topic modeling.
* KMeans Clustering - Implements K Means clustering using SciKit Learn.
* Graph - Graphing links between articles in the SEP using NetworkX.

As of the last update, this is just a fun project and a proof of concept. It still requires a lot of work both technically and intellectually for it to become a real project. For now, this is only intended with educational purposes. No data is included in this repository.
